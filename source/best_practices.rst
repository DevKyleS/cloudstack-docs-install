Best Practices
==============

Deploying a cloud is challenging. There are many different technology
choices to make, and CloudStack is flexible enough in its configuration
that there are many possible ways to combine and configure the chosen
technology. This section contains suggestions and requirements about
cloud deployments.

These should be treated as suggestions and not absolutes. However, we do
encourage anyone planning to build a cloud outside of these guidelines
to seek guidance and advice on the project mailing lists.

Process Best Practices
----------------------

-  

   A staging system that models the production environment is strongly
   advised. It is critical if customizations have been applied to
   CloudStack.

-  

   Allow adequate time for installation, a beta, and learning the
   system. Installs with basic networking can be done in hours. Installs
   with advanced networking usually take several days for the first
   attempt, with complicated installations taking longer. For a full
   production system, allow at least 4-8 weeks for a beta to work
   through all of the integration issues. You can get help from fellow
   users on the cloudstack-users mailing list.

Setup Best Practices
--------------------

-  

   Each host should be configured to accept connections only from
   well-known entities such as the CloudStack Management Server or your
   network monitoring software.

-  

   Use multiple clusters per pod if you need to achieve a certain switch
   density.

-  

   Primary storage mountpoints or LUNs should not exceed 6 TB in size.
   It is better to have multiple smaller primary storage elements per
   cluster than one large one.

-  

   When exporting shares on primary storage, avoid data loss by
   restricting the range of IP addresses that can access the storage.
   See "Linux NFS on Local Disks and DAS" or "Linux NFS on iSCSI".

-  

   NIC bonding is straightforward to implement and provides increased
   reliability.

-  

   10G networks are generally recommended for storage access when larger
   servers that can support relatively more VMs are used.

-  

   Host capacity should generally be modeled in terms of RAM for the
   guests. Storage and CPU may be overprovisioned. RAM may not. RAM is
   usually the limiting factor in capacity designs.

-  

   (XenServer) Configure the XenServer dom0 settings to allocate more
   memory to dom0. This can enable XenServer to handle larger numbers of
   virtual machines. We recommend 2940 MB of RAM for XenServer dom0. For
   instructions on how to do this, see
   `http://support.citrix.com/article/CTX126531 <http://support.citrix.com/article/CTX126531>`__.
   The article refers to XenServer 5.6, but the same information applies
   to XenServer 6.0.

Maintenance Best Practices
--------------------------

-  

   Monitor host disk space. Many host failures occur because the host's
   root disk fills up from logs that were not rotated adequately.

-  

   Monitor the total number of VM instances in each cluster, and disable
   allocation to the cluster if the total is approaching the maximum
   that the hypervisor can handle. Be sure to leave a safety margin to
   allow for the possibility of one or more hosts failing, which would
   increase the VM load on the other hosts as the VMs are redeployed.
   Consult the documentation for your chosen hypervisor to find the
   maximum permitted number of VMs per host, then use CloudStack global
   configuration settings to set this as the default limit. Monitor the
   VM activity in each cluster and keep the total number of VMs below a
   safe level that allows for the occasional host failure. For example,
   if there are N hosts in the cluster, and you want to allow for one
   host in the cluster to be down at any given time, the total number of
   VM instances you can permit in the cluster is at most (N-1) \*
   (per-host-limit). Once a cluster reaches this number of VMs, use the
   CloudStack UI to disable allocation to the cluster.

.. warning:: The lack of up-do-date hotfixes can lead to data corruption and lost
VMs. Be sure all the hotfixes provided by the hypervisor vendor are applied.
Track the release of hypervisor patches through your hypervisor vendorâ€™s
support channel, and apply patches as soon as possible after they are
released. CloudStack will not track or notify you of required hypervisor
patches. It is essential that your hosts are completely up to date with
the provided hypervisor patches. The hypervisor vendor is likely to
refuse to support any system that is not up to date with patches.
